# Complex Networks Project 
## Project developed during the course of a graduation subject
### Python + Networkx Library to manipulate graphs + MatPlotLib to generate chart analysis 

Complex Networks is a very diverse field of study. It mostly uses Graphs Theory to make very interesting and important metrics-based analysis.

In this project, I used a graph repository from the internet with information about the airport network in the USA in the year of 1997.

Each airport is represented by a node and every flight that is served by them is represented as a edge from it to another airport.

Along the study, representations of this network were drawed and a few Centrality Metrics were calculated in order to achieve conclusions about this transportation system.
